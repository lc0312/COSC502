      "chan was born on 7 april 1954 in british hong kong as chan kong-sang (chinese: 陳港生; lit. 'chan the hong kong-born') to charles and lee-lee chan, political refugees from the chinese civil war. in circa 1937, chan's father, originally named  fang daolong, briefly worked as a secret agent for lieutenant general dai li, the chief spy in kuomintang-ruled china. for fear of being arrested by the communist government, chan's father fled to british hong kong in the 1940s and changed his surname from fang to chan. chan was his wife chan lee-lee’s surname. chan discovered his father's identity and changed his chinese name to fang shilong (房仕龍) in the late 1990s, the name he would have been named according to his kin's genealogy book.chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the french consul's residence in the victoria peak, british hong kong, as his father worked as a cook there. chan attended the nah-hwa primary school on hong kong island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school. in 1960, his father emigrated to canberra, australia to work as the head cook for the american embassy, and chan was sent to the china drama academy, a peking opera school run by master yu jim-yuen. chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. he eventually became part of the seven little fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name yuen lo (元樓) in homage to his master. chan became close friends with fellow group members sammo hung and yuen biao, and the three of them later became known as the three brothers or three dragons. after entering the film industry, chan along with sammo hung got the opportunity to train in hapkido under the grand master jin pal kim, and chan eventually attained a black belt.chan joined his parents in canberra, australia in 1971, where he briefly attended dickson college and worked as a construction worker. a fellow builder named jack took chan under his wing, thus earning chan the nickname of \"little jack,\" later shortened to \"jackie\", which has stuck with him ever since.\n",

      "in 1976, jackie chan received a telegram from willie chan, a film producer in the hong kong film industry who had been impressed with jackie's stunt choreography work. willie chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by lo wei. lo saw chan's performance in the john woo film hand of death (1976) and planned to model him after bruce lee with the film new fist of fury. his stage name was changed to 成龍 (literally \"becoming the dragon\", sing4 lung4 in jyutping or rarely as cheng long in pinyin), to emphasise his similarity to bruce lee, whose stage name meant \"lee the little dragon\" in chinese. (note that \"dragon\" in lee's name referred to lee's birth year being the dragon zodiac, not the chinese dragon.) the film was unsuccessful because chan was not accustomed to lee's martial arts style. despite the film's failure, lo wei continued producing films with similar themes, but with little improvement at the box office.chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 film snake in the eagle's shadow, shot while he was loaned to seasonal film corporation under a two-picture deal. director yuen woo-ping allowed chan complete freedom over his stunt work. the film established the comedic kung fu genre, and proved refreshing to the hong kong audience. the same year, chan then starred in drunken master, which finally propelled him to mainstream success.upon chan's return to lo wei's studio, lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of drunken master, producing and also showed new features at the time with jackie as the stunt director half a loaf of kung fu and spiritual kung fu. he also gave chan the opportunity to make his directorial debut in the fearless hyena. when willie chan left the company, he advised jackie to decide for himself whether or not to stay with lo wei. during the shooting of fearless hyena part ii, chan broke his contract and joined golden harvest, prompting lo to blackmail chan with triads, blaming willie for his star's departure. the dispute was resolved with the help of fellow actor and director jimmy wang yu, allowing chan to stay with golden harvest.\n",

      "willie chan became jackie's personal manager and firm friend, and remained so for over 30 years. he was instrumental in launching chan's international career, beginning with his first forays into the american film industry in the 1980s. his first hollywood film was the big brawl in 1980. chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film the cannonball run, which grossed over us$100 million worldwide. despite being largely ignored by north american audiences in favour of established american actors such as burt reynolds, chan was impressed by the outtakes shown at the closing credits, inspiring him to include the same device in his future films.\n",
      "after the commercial failure of the protector in 1985, chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the us market, returning his focus to hong kong films.back in hong kong, chan's films began to reach a larger audience in east asia, with early successes in the lucrative japanese market including drunken master, the young master (1980) and dragon lord (1982). the young master went on to beat previous box office records set by bruce lee and established chan as hong kong cinema's top star. with dragon lord, he began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences, including the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground.chan produced a number of action comedy films with his opera school friends sammo hung and yuen biao. the three co-starred together for the first time in 1983 in project a, which introduced a dangerous stunt-driven style of martial arts that won it the best action design award at the third annual hong kong film awards. over the following two years, the \"three brothers\" appeared in wheels on meals and the original lucky stars trilogy. in 1985, chan made the first police story film, a crime action film in which chan performed a number of dangerous stunts. it won best film at the 1986 hong kong film awards. in 1986, chan played \"asian hawk,\" an indiana jones-esque character, in the film armour of god. the film was chan's biggest domestic box office success up to that point, grossing over hk$35 million.\n",

      "in the late 1980s and early 1990s, chan starred in a number of successful sequels beginning with project a part ii and police story 2, which won the award for best action choreography at the 1989 hong kong film awards. this was followed by armour of god ii: operation condor, and police story 3: super cop, for which chan won the best actor award at the 1993 golden horse film festival. in 1994, chan reprised his role as wong fei-hung in drunken master ii, which was listed in time magazine's all-time 100 movies. another sequel, police story 4: first strike, brought more awards and domestic box office success for chan, but did not fare as well in foreign markets.by the mid-1990s, he was the most popular action movie star in asia and europe. up until january 1995, his films had grossed over hk$500 million (us$70 million) in hong kong and ¥39 billion (us$415 million) in japan, while having sold over 33 million box office admissions in france, germany, italy and spain up until then. despite his international success, he was not very successful in north america, where he had only two wide releases as a leading actor, the big brawl and the protector, grossing us$9.51 million (us$32 million adjusted for inflation). despite this, there was a thriving north american home video market for chan's hong kong films by the mid-1990s.chan rekindled his hollywood ambitions in the 1990s, but refused early offers to play villains in hollywood films to avoid being typecast in future roles. for example, sylvester stallone offered him the role of simon phoenix, a criminal in the futuristic film demolition man. chan declined and the role was taken by wesley snipes.chan finally succeeded in establishing a foothold in the north american market in 1995 with a worldwide release of rumble in the bronx, attaining a cult following in the united states that was rare for hong kong movie stars. the success of rumble in the bronx led to a 1996 release of police story 3: super cop in the united states under the title supercop, which grossed a total of us$16,270,600. chan's first huge blockbuster success came when he co-starred with chris tucker in the 1998 buddy cop action comedy rush hour, grossing us$130 million in the united states alone. this film made him a hollywood star, after which he wrote his autobiography in collaboration with jeff yang entitled i am jackie chan.\n",

      "chan has performed most of his own stunts throughout his film career, which are choreographed by the jackie chan stunt team. the team was established in 1983, and chan has used them in all his subsequent films to make choreographing easier, given his understanding of each member's abilities. chan and his team undertake many of the stunts performed by other characters in his films, shooting the scenes so that their faces are obscured.in the early 1980s, jackie chan began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences in films such as the young master (1980) and especially dragon lord (1982), which featured a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes required for a single scene, with 2900 takes, and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a backflip off a loft and falls to the lower ground. in 1983, project a saw the official formation of the jackie chan stunt team and added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and typical slapstick humor; at one point, chan falls from the top of a clock tower through a series of fabric canopies. critics have compared his comedic stunts in project a to buster keaton, who was also known to perform his own stunts, although chan himself had not watched keaton's films until years after project a released; according to chan, project a was an evolution of the action stunt work he had been doing in earlier kung fu comedy films since the young master.police story (1985) contained many large-scale action scenes, including an opening sequence featuring a car chase through a shanty town, chan stopping a double-decker bus with his service revolver and a climactic fight scene in a shopping mall. this final scene earned the film the nickname \"glass story\" by the crew, due to the huge number of panes of sugar glass that were broken. during a stunt in this last scene, in which chan slides down a pole from several stories up, the lights covering the pole had heated it considerably, resulting in chan suffering second-degree burns, particularly to his hands, as well as a back injury and dislocation of his pelvis upon landing. chan performed similarly elaborate stunts in numerous other films, such as several police story sequels, project a part ii, the armor of god series, dragons forever, drunken master ii, rumble in the bronx, and the rush hour series, among others.\n",
      "the dangerous nature of his stunts makes it difficult to get insurance, especially in the united states where his stunt work is contractually limited. chan holds the guinness world record for \"most stunts by a living actor\", which emphasises that \"no insurance company will underwrite chan's productions in which he performs all his own stunts\".chan has been injured frequently when attempting stunts; many of them have been shown as outtakes or as bloopers during the closing credits of his films. he came closest to death filming armour of god when he fell from a tree and fractured his skull. over the years, he has dislocated his pelvis and also broken numerous parts of his body, including his fingers, toes, nose, both cheekbones, hips, sternum, neck, ankle, and ribs. promotional materials for rumble in the bronx emphasised that he performed all of the stunts, and one version of the movie poster even diagrammed his many injuries.\n",

      "chan created his screen persona as a response to the late bruce lee and the numerous imitators who appeared before and after lee's death. lee's characters were typically stern, morally upright heroes. in contrast, chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular men, often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends, or families, who always triumph in the end despite the odds. additionally, he has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of lee's: where lee held his arms wide, chan holds his tight to the body; where lee was loose and flowing, chan is tight and choppy. despite the success of the rush hour series, chan has stated that he is not a fan of it since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie nor understands american humor.american filmmaker quentin tarantino classified chan's style of acting and filmmaking as physical comedy, and considered him one of the greatest in the genre. british filmmaker edgar wright describes jackie chan as an \"expressive\" visual performer with an everyman persona. he notes that, in contrast to other action heroes (such as bruce lee, sylvester stallone, clint eastwood or arnold schwarzenegger), chan presents himself as a loveable \"goofball\" underdog who overcomes the odds with almost \"superhuman\" acrobatic stunts and fighting abilities.in the 2000s, the ageing chan grew tired of being typecast as an action hero, prompting him to act with more emotion in his latest films. in new police story, he portrayed a character suffering from alcoholism and mourning his murdered colleagues. to further shed the image of a \"nice guy\", chan played an antihero for the first time in rob-b-hood starring as thongs, a burglar with gambling problems. in 2008, chan met actor vijay and discussed about his stunts in his films putting his life at risk. chan plays a low-level gangster in 2009's shinjuku incident, a serious drama set in tokyo about unsavory characters.\n",
